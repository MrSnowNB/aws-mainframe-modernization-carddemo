## Post-Mortem

### What was planned (G0) vs. what was built (G2)
<!-- Describe any drift. "No drift" is a valid and good answer. -->

### Metrics Delta
<!-- Compare G3 results to G0 Success Criteria -->

| success_criterion | target | achieved | delta |
|-------------------|--------|----------|-------|
| SC-01             |        |          |       |
| SC-02             |        |          |       |
| SC-03             |        |          |       |

### Lessons Learned
<!-- What would you change in G0 next time? Any surprises? -->

### Open Issues
<!-- Anything NOT resolved that should become a new /aifirst task -->
